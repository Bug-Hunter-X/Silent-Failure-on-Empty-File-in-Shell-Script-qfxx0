# Silent Failure on Empty File in Shell Script

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a shell script where the script fails silently when attempting to process an empty file. The script uses a `while` loop to read and process lines from a file. If the file is empty, the loop doesn't execute, and no error is reported.

## Bug Description
The provided shell script correctly handles cases where the target file doesn't exist.  However, if the file exists but is empty, the script completes without any output or error messages, making it difficult to detect the problem.

## Bug Reproduction
1. Create an empty file named `my_file.txt`.
2. Run the script `bug.sh`.
3. Observe that the script exits without any indication of an error or processing.

## Solution
The solution checks the return value of the `read` command to detect the end of the file explicitly, which handles the empty file case correctly.
